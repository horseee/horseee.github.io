Hi there! üëã

Welcome to **Bhanu Prakash Vangala**‚Äôs website!

I‚Äôm currently a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Missouri, Columbia (Aug 2023 ‚Äì Jun 2027), co-advised by [Dr. Jianlin Cheng](https://calla.rnet.missouri.edu/cheng/) and [Dr. Tanu Malik](https://engineering.missouri.edu/faculty/tanu-malik/).

Previously, I earned my M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Missouri (GPA: 4.0/4.0), where I worked on deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in distributed computing environments advised by [Dr. Grant J Scott](https://scottgs.mufaculty.umsystem.edu/). I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering (Data Analytics) at Vellore Institute of Technology, India, where I explored multilingual NLP and large-scale social media analysis.

My core research interests include:

üå≤ **Trustworthy and Interpretable AI**  
Developing systems that can reason transparently, self-reflect, and correct their own outputs‚Äîimproving reliability and reducing harmful or misleading responses.

üå± **Efficient and Scalable Language Models**  
Focusing on model compression, memory optimization, and large-scale deployment of LLMs for real-time inference in resource-constrained and HPC environments.

üåø **Factuality and Evaluation in Language Models**  
Designing evaluation benchmarks and hybrid techniques to assess consistency, factual accuracy, and context-grounded reasoning in LLMs.

üçÉ **AI for Scientific Discovery**  
Applying LLMs in scientific domains such as materials science, biomedical research, and policy modeling‚Äîempowering AI to support researchers in hypothesis generation and knowledge synthesis.

Beyond research, I enjoy mentoring students as a Teaching Assistant for full-stack web development courses, helping them connect theoretical concepts with real-world applications. I‚Äôm also passionate about guiding international students through blogging and sharing insights on pursuing higher education abroad.

Thanks for stopping by‚Äîfeel free to explore my work on [GitHub](https://bhanuprakashvangala.github.io) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vangalabhanuprakash/)!
